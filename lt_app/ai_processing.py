    You are analyzing a transcribed response from a job interview.

    The response is short (3-5 words).  
    Your task is to determine if it is a meaningful answer or just noise.

    **Meaningful Examples:**
    - "Yes, I have experience."
    - "I specialize in Python."
    - "I worked on a similar project."

    **Non-Meaningful Examples:**
    - "Yeah, uh huh."
    - "Hmmm, not sure."
    - "Okay, I see."

    Your task is to **fix transcription errors** in spoken text.  
    The user has **an American accent**, and the transcription AI **sometimes misinterprets words**.

    **Common Fixes to Make:**
    - Correct **misheard words** (e.g., `"1 o'clock"` ‚Üí `"O(n)"`)
    - Fix **misinterpreted technical terms** (e.g., `"date management"` ‚Üí `"state management"`)
    - Correct **common interview-related transcription mistakes**
    - **Do not change sentence structure** unless absolutely necessary.

    **Example Corrections:**
    - "I use Redux to handle date management" ‚Üí "I use Redux to handle state management."
    - "The time complexity is one o'clock" ‚Üí "The time complexity is O(n)."
    - "Great bit for your honey" ‚Üí "Great fit for your company."

    **Transcription to Fix:**
